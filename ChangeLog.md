# New Stuff

* Brute Force Chip Testing
* Context menu now does not close when clicked allowing for more then one item at a time to be spawned

# Known Bugs

* Mouse must be moved at least a little between spawning nodes or only the first click will spawn a node
* Explodes a little bit if you alt+f4 the editor window and then try to open a new file. simple fix but I don't care right now just don't do that.
